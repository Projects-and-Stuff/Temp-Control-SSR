- No budget, but aim for lower cost
- Over-engineer to ensure survival in rough environments
- Under $100

Discuss how I determined the wattage to select for the current-limiting resistors.
Maximum Forward current is 20mA
I want to aim for 10mA
The input voltage is 5VDC
The forward voltage is about 1.7 to 2.2 volts

Now we can run 2 calculations to determine the appropriate range of resistors:
5 - 2.2 = 2.8 / 0.01 = 280 Ohms
5 - 1.7 = 3.3 / 0.01 = 330 Ohms

To verify that anything in this range will meet our needs, we'll check what current values we get if the forward voltage drop across the LED is a bit different than we expected:
2.8 / 330 = 0.085 = 8.5mA
3.3 / 280 = 0.0118 = 11.8mA

Both of these values are well within the allowable current range for the LEDs, and still very near what we were looking for in total current.

When selecting a resistor, one of the specifications is power handling. To determine the maximum power our resistor will have to deal with, we do the following:
- Calculate the maximum voltage drop across the resistor: 5 - 1.7 = 3.3
- Remember that P = I * E
- So for the maximum current that will be passing through our resistor: P = 0.0118 * 3.3 = 0.03894W
- Because I want to over-engineer a bit, I'll double the value, but you should always give yourself a bit of fudge-factor by increasing the value 10-20%
- I'll select the cheapest resistor between 280 and 330 ohms that can handle at least 0.08W

Why I chose to use the SCK ISP pin as the driver for the DS18B20 sensor: In order for the sensor to communicate, it must ....

Is it possible that just by seeing a clock on the line it might try to communicate? In which case I need to isolate the sensor from the programmer.

Nope, this is a problem as the 1-wire protocol initializes simply with a puls. So the SCK may be assumed to be the initialization pulse, after which the slave device (the sensor) will pull the line down for another pulse to signal its presence.

Might be able to use the reset line, though? Since during programming it will be held to a single state the entire time, which shouldn't confuse the 1-wire.
